              Peng, Sha and Deng, Liangchun and Kang, Ping and Zhang, Xiaoling",
  abstract = "Domestic trade flourishes with economic development and the
              spatial separation of production and consumption. Therefore, the
              prosperity of trade is accompanied by the transfer of pollution
              from the demand side to the supply side, which could potentially
              worsen the environmental quality of the supply side. Despite a
              large number of studies on the pollution haven hypothesis in
              international trade, little attention has been paid to testing
              the hypothesis in domestic trade. Here, combining a multiregional
              input-output analysis and a gravity model of trade in China, we
              provide an empirical test to address this problem for the first
              time. We also assess the factors affecting the SO2 emissions
              embodied in trade, including population, economic development,
              coal consumption, distance, and environmental regulations. We
              found that domestic trade contributed approximate one third of
              the total SO2 emissions in China, and interprovincial transfers
              of SO2 embodied in trade were significantly determined by the
              population, economic development, coal consumption of the trade
              pairs, as well as their distance. SO2 emission mitigation
              policies, such as emission reduction target and sulfur dioxide
              control zone, has a more significant influence on the direct
              transfer of SO2 emission via direct bilateral trade, while their
              effects were largely offset by indirect trade (through
              third-party transfers). Our results do not support the pollution
              haven hypothesis existed in domestic trade in China during
              2007-2012. Our paper sets an example and provides a reference for
              the domestic pollution transfer problem from an econometric
              perspective. Further attempts on testing pollution haven
              hypothesis in consideration of various pollutants are still

  abstract  = "China's rapid economic growth has been accompanied by a high
               level of environmental degradation. One of the major sources of
               health and ecosystem damages is sulfur dioxide (SO2). Reducing
               SO2 emissions is a priority of China's environmental
               authorities, and the 11th Five-Year Plan (2006--2010) includes
               the target of reducing total SO2 emissions by 10 percent from
               the 2005 level. Given the rapid increase in SO2 emissions that
               is expected to occur in absence of intervention, attaining this
               target will require a significant effort. This article examines
               the two major policy measures the government is taking to
               achieve the SO2 target: a shutdown of many small, inefficient
               power plants and the installation of desulfurization equipment

               economy-wide impacts of the two policies using a multisector
               model of the Chinese economy. We find that in the aggregate, the
               economic benefits of the shutdown of the small power plants are
               large enough to offset the costs of the desulfurization
               equipment, even without considering the substantial

              pollution",
  author   = "Brajer, Victor and Mead, Robert W and Xiao, Feng",
  abstract = "Intuitively, the concept of an Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC)
              is relatively easy to understand: pollution will initially
              increase with economic development but then decrease again as
              incomes attain a certain level. The overall concept of pollution,
              however, actually consists of various components which may behave
              differently and are not easily combined into a single measure. As
              a result, the measurement or tracking of an EKC becomes more
              difficult as one tries to develop a tractable measure of
              pollution for modeling or policy purposes. For example, in China
              levels of sulfur dioxide and particulate pollution show some
              signs of diminishing while nitrogen dioxide levels have increased
              as China's auto fleet has grown. Consequently, different studies
              estimating an EKC often generate different results depending upon
              which pollutant is used and how it is measured. This paper
              generates composite measures of Chinese air pollution using
              Nemerow methodology as well as a new epidemiological index based
              upon the health effects of the pollutants. The paper then tests
              these index measures to determine whether they display evidence
              of an EKC and also to examine how they behave in comparison to
              the individual pollutants.",

  abstract = "This paper explores the effect of credit constraints on
              production-generated pollution emissions. I develop a theoretical
              model wherein polluting firms borrow externally to finance
              investment in various assets, subject to a credit constraint. The
              main insight of the model is that credit constraints distort the
              composition of assets towards over-investment in tangible assets,
              which can be pledged as collateral, thereby increasing the
              intensity of emissions. The predictions of the model are tested
              using a unique dataset consisting of plant-level measures of
              pollution emissions and creditworthiness. The empirical results
              indicate that credit constraints significantly increase pollution
              emissions (even after accounting for the scale effect), and the
              results withstand multiple robustness checks. Moreover, the
              effect of credit constraints is particularly acute in industries
              with greater reliance on external credit. Finally, I demonstrate

              the industry structure distribution and trade flows of embodied
              pollution during 2000--2014, the driving factors of the changes
              in embodied pollutant are further explored by Structural

              pollution reduction. Since the year 2007, China has totally
              become a net exporter of embodied pollutions, and has become to

              dioxide, wastewater, and soot. Our main findings are as follows:
              (1) compared to state-owned enterprises (SOEs), both
              foreign-owned firms and domestic public-listed firms exhibit less

              for the changes of new polluting firms' location choice from the
              coastal provinces, which have strict environmental mandates, to
              the western provinces, which have lax environmental mandates, and
              demonstrates the distinct location patterns of heterogeneous
              polluting firms. While foreign polluting firms were generally
              driven by the mandates, domestic polluting firms were more
              resistant and were driven to the western provinces only after
              2007. As a result, the potential pollution transfer would
              threaten the more fragile water environments and public health in
              western provinces. We thus posit a perverse incentive of current
              environmental policy and recommend integrated water management as
              well as close coordination of local governments to improve the
              efficacy of environmental regulation in China.",

  abstract  = "? Abstract?China is rapidly developing as evidenced by enhanced
               urbanization and industrialization and greatly increased energy
               consumption. However, these have brought Chinese cities a
               variety of urban air pollution problems in recent decades.
               During the 1970s, black smoke from stacks became the
               characteristic of Chinese industrial cities; in the 1980s, many
               southern cities began to suffer serious acid rain pollution; and
               recently, the air quality in large cities has deteriorated due
               to nitrous oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and photochemical
               smog, which are typical of vehicle pollution. Some cities now
               have a mixture of these. Urban air pollution influences both the
               health of citizens and the development of cities. To control air
               pollution and protect the atmospheric environment, the Chinese
               government has implemented a variety of programs. This paper
               first reviews the current status of air quality in Chinese
               cities, especially key cities, then describes the
               characteristics of some major urban air pollutants, including
               total suspended particles (TSP), respirable particles 10 microns
               or less in diameter (PM10), very fine particles 2.5 microns or
               less in diameter (PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SO2), acid rain, NOx,
               and photochemical smog. Two specific topics, SO2 and acid rain
               control and vehicle emission control, are used to illustrate the
               actions that the government has taken and future plans. Finally,
               a case study of the Chinese capital, Beijing, is presented with
               a discussion of its main air pollution problems, recently
               implemented control measures and their effects, and future
               strategies for urban air quality improvement.",

              that have received little attention and that give rise to
              unexpected outcomes with respect to industry performance. First,
              compliance to regulations is likely to provide positive forces
              leading to improved productivity because a) induced innovation
              and/or the adoption of cleaner technologies among polluting firms
              enhance industrial activities, and b) regulations stimulate
              market dynamics through the entry of more efficient firms and the
              exit of less efficient ones. Second, regulations carry
              externality effects for non-polluting energy-intensive firms,
              when the energy sector is prone to regulations. By exploiting
              plausibly exogenous variation in regulatory stringency generated
              by the Two Control Zone policy in China across cities and across
              industries, we find evidence that pollution-intensive firms
              substantially improved economic performance, whereas
              energy-intensive firms received negative externalities. The
              findings are robust to the inclusions of city-specific trends,

                 profitable recently. As the largest shareholder, the state has
                 not asked SOEs to pay dividends in the past. Therefore, some
                 have suggested that the state should ask SOEs to pay
                 dividends. Indeed, the Chinese government has adopted this
                 policy advice and started to demand dividend payment starting
                 from 2008. While we do not question the soundness of the
                 dividend policy, the point we raise is whether those profits
                 are real if all costs owned by SOEs are properly accounted
                 for. Among other things, we are interested in investigating
                 whether the profits of SOEs would still be as large as they

                 other companies after controlling for some fundamental factors
                 for profitability and individual firm characteristics. In
                 addition, our estimates show that if SOEs were to pay a market
                 interest rate, their existing profits would be entirely wiped

              Squares method and the Least Square Dummy Variable method in the
              paper. Results show that the pilot carbon emission trading policy
              leads to the expansion of employment scales and the reduction of
              carbon emissions after controlling for the environmental
              regulation, population size, economic level, and other important
              variables. Thus, it implies that an employment double dividend

              emission trading policy only without adding any control variable.
              The effect is further verified based on a robustness checks and a
              placebo test. Furthermore, from the perspective of

  author   = "Berger, Jo{\"e}l",
  abstract = "Abstract Many green products are costlier than their nongreen
              counterparts, for a variety of reasons. This ?green premium? is a
              key challenge marketers face when targeting consumers with these
              green products. A potential solution to this issue is provided by
              signaling theory. According to the theory, green products can
              have a signaling benefit. This benefit acts as an incentive for
              consumers to pay a premium for environmentally friendly products
              that can even out their price disadvantage (the green signaling
              hypothesis). Previous studies have tested the green signaling
              hypothesis with hypothetical buying decisions. The research at
              hand tests the green signaling hypothesis with
              incentive-compatible purchase decisions in a laboratory setting
              with student subjects. As predicted, subjects exhibit a higher
              willingness to pay for green products when the product choice (a
              nongreen product vs. a costlier green counterpart) is public
              rather than private. The results also suggest that green
              signalers are treated more favorably in social interactions. The
              main result is that a signaling benefit can even out moderate
              green premiums. One implication of this is the idea that
              marketers should design green products that are costlier than
              their nongreen counterparts in a way that renders them clearly
              recognizable as green. At the same time, marketers should avoid
              marketing everyday green products with a high green premium.",

              SDGs over 2000--2016 at the global level and for low-income
              countries, using a representative indicator for each goal. We
              then estimate the welfare changes for improvements in No Poverty
              (SDG1) net of any welfare gains and losses in attaining each of
              the remaining 16 goals. For the world, we estimate the per capita
              welfare change of reductions in 2000--2016 poverty rates net of
              any gains or losses in attaining each of the remaining 16 goals
              is $12,737 per capita. This is more than double the welfare
              change of $5671 per person for poverty reduction alone from 2000
              to 2016. However, once interactions with other SDGs are taken
              into account, the net welfare change for poverty reduction in
              poor economies from 2000 to 2016 is $244 per person, which is
              almost 20\% lower than the welfare estimate of $299 per capita of
              poverty reduction on its own. Such an analysis helps policy
              makers prioritize improvements towards one goal or set of goals,
              and show explicitly the net gains and losses for achieving one
              goal while impacting others. For example, over 2000--2016 the
              world may have come closer to attaining the No Poverty goal, but
              at the expense of other critical SDGs, especially those
              associated with the environment. This research has important

               diff{\'e}rences fondamentales de la conception de Kornai avec la

               {\'e}conomie de march{\'e} concurrentielle, Kornai soutient que

               r{\'e}f{\'e}rence normatif afin de mesurer les inefficacit{\'e}s
               de la CBL. En fait, la position de Kornai concernant la CBD et

               la troisi{\`e}me approche. In this paper, we have distinguished
               three different conceptions of the budget constraint (BC).The
               first one, introduced by Clower, regards the BC as a universal
               (unconditional) rational planning postulate This does not imply
               market equilibrium or optimality. The second one, advocated by
               Kornai, considers the BC as a conditional empirical fact
               regarding the specific behavioural regularity of agents that is
               determined by particular institutional setups. The third one is
               implicitly held by a number of endogenous explanations of the
               SBC notably by the Complete (optimal) Contracts Theory and the
               Public Choice Theory. It regards the BC as a matter of choice by
               rational agents. While Clower and Kornai try to understand the
               BC in the context of disequilibrium or at least independently of
               equilibrium or optimality conditions, the partisans of the third
               approach integrate the BC in the process of dynamic
               optimization. Although Kornai's conception of the BC standpoint
               is contradictory. In his appraisal of the hard budget constraint
               (HBC) in case of competitive market economy, Kornai contends
               that the application of the BC is equivalent to the realization
               of Walras' Law. He then uses this ideal HBC as a normative
               reference in order to measure the inefficiencies of the soft
               budget constraint (SBC). In fact, Kornai's standpoint with
               regard to the HBC and his efficiency analysis are in tune with
               the third approach.",

               plant-level productivity. The restructuring involved significant

               Firms' choices on whether to liquidate, and on input quantities

               generates a selection and a simultaneity problem when estimating

               has precipitously declined due to heavy industrial output and
               coal consumption. The country is currently the world's largest
               greenhouse-gas emitter and several of the most polluted cities
               in the world are in China. Yet, millions of people continue
               moving to its cities seeking opportunities.Blue Skies over

               impacts local and global environmental challenges. Focusing on
               day-to-day choices made by the nation's citizens, families, and
               government, Matthew Kahn and Siqi Zheng examine how Chinese
               urbanites are increasingly demanding cleaner living conditions
               and consider where China might be headed in terms of sustainable
               urban growth. Kahn and Zheng delve into life in China's cities
               from the personal perspectives of the rich, middle class, and
               poor, and how they cope with the stresses of pollution. Urban
               parents in China have a strong desire to protect their children

               from the rising middle class places pressure on government

              variations in exports between cities and sectors, over time, and,

              the policy, which is sharper the more polluting the industry.
              Further, we find that the observed effect is mainly driven by
              privately owned firms, whereas exports of state-owned firms seem

               model demonstrates that reducing credit constraints increases
               the scale of production (scale effect) and increases the number
               of firms taking up production (market size effect), while it
               also reduces emissions per unit of output (technique effect) and
               increases the share of firms investing in the technology upgrade
               (composition effect). Because the former and latter effects are
               plausibly confounding in nature, the net effect of credit
               constraints on pollution emissions is an empirical question.
               This paper demonstrates that, using variation in the timing of
               credit market reforms, reducing credit constraints significantly
               improves air pollution (sulphur dioxide and lead concentrations)
               in both developing and developed countries. The results are
               robust using various approaches, including two-way fixed
               effects, lagged dependent variables, and
               difference-in-differences.",
